# termdaw
A daw, in a terminal.
Termdaw is a (or should become a) terminal, graph based programmable pipeline digital audio workstation that is friendly to automatization and AI/Algorithmic composition.

## MVP Goals
- Audio
  - [x] Render audio
    - Any samplerate: will up or down sample from project rate
    - 8, 16, 24 or 32 bit bitdepth
  - [x] Play back audio
- Terminal UX
    - [x] Controls: play, pause, stop
    - [ ] Controls: set time, dash in time
    - [x] Controls: refresh, render
    - [ ] View: Terminal logging, warnings, errors, colors
    - [x] Toml configuration
- Structure
  - [x] Sample Bank
  - [x] Graph rendering structure
  - [x] Floww Bank
- Base Vertex, with:
  - [x] Gain
  - [x] Panning
  - [x] Input summation
- Vertex types
  - [x] Sum vertex
  - [x] Normalize vertex
  - [x] Sample loop vertex
  - [x] Sample floww vertex (emit sample on note)
  - [x] Lv2 fx vertex
  - [ ] Buildin floww synth
- Floww
  - [ ] Read from midi
  - [ ] Read from floww
  - [ ] Linear interpolation of notes
- Lua
  - [x] To configure the project(sample rate, etc)
  - [x] Load resources (samples and plugins)
  - [x] Construct graph
  - [x] Refreshable: remove old, add new, keep same

## Goals for later
- [ ] Bound normalization
- [ ] Automation
- [ ] Floww/Midi pipeline
- [ ] Mono support
- [ ] Lv2 midi instrument vertex
- [ ] Envelope vertex
- [ ] Lufs mastering tool

## Example
```toml
[project]
name = "Example Project"

[settings]
buffer_length = 1024
project_samplerate = 48000
main = "project.lua"
```
```lua
-- Our lua file, where we do all the work
set_length(3.0);
set_render_samplerate(44100);
set_render_bitdepth(16);
set_output_file("outp.wav");

load_sample("snare", "/home/cody/doc/samples/drumnbass/snare-1/snare-1-v-9.wav");
load_sample("kick", "/home/cody/doc/samples/drumnbass/kick/kick-v-9.wav");

add_sampleloop("one", 1.0, 0.0, "snare");
add_sampleloop("two", 1.0, 0.0, "kick");
add_normalize("sum", 1.0, 0.0);

connect("one", "sum");
connect("two", "sum");

set_output("sum");
```
